          <dt>Marinate the Chicken:</dt>
          <dd>
            In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt,
            ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala
            powder, lemon juice, and salt. Mix well to coat the chicken pieces
            evenly. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (preferably 2 hours
            in the refrigerator).

          <dt>Prepare the Rice:</dt>
          <dd>
            In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the soaked rice, bay
            leaf, cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and salt. Cook the rice
            until it's 70-80% done (parboiled). Drain the rice and set aside.

          <dt>Cook the chicken:</dt>
          <dd>
            Heat ghee or oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan or pressure cooker.
            Add the sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown. <br />
            Add the marinated chicken pieces along with chopped tomatoes and
            green chilies. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the chicken is partially
            cooked and the tomatoes are softened.

          <dt>Layering the Biryani:</dt>
          <dd>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In the same pan (if large enough), or in a separate large pot,
                begin layering the biryani. Spread half of the partially cooked
                rice evenly over the chicken.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sprinkle half of the chopped coriander leaves and mint leaves
                over the rice.
              </li>
              <li>Repeat with the remaining rice, spreading it evenly</li>
              <li>
                Sprinkle the remaining coriander leaves, mint leaves, and fried
                onions on top. Drizzle the saffron milk over the rice for added
                flavor and color.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <dt>Dum Cooking (Slow Cooking):</dt>
          <dd>
            Cover the pan tightly with a lid. You can seal the edges with dough
            or a tight-fitting foil to trap the steam. Cook on low heat for
            20-25 minutes, allowing the biryani to cook in its own steam (dum)
            until the rice and chicken are fully cooked and infused with
            flavors.
